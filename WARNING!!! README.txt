One of the scripts in the scripts folder called "funny red flash" makes it so that the screen
flashes red when you miss note, if you are epileptic obviously don't enable it.
Just in case somebody doesn't read the warning I've made it so the script doesn't run,
so you have to enable it yourself, all you have to do is remove the funny brackets there are two of
them the first one will be this "--[[" and the second one will be like this "]]--" once you get
rid of those it'll run
